"I've designed a quiz app that delivers a personalized experience with 5 randomly selected questions from a pool of 30. Each question is timed for 10 seconds, and users receive instant feedback on their answers. Once the quiz is complete, a detailed score and performance summary are presented. The app, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a dynamic and enjoyable quizzing experience."
